Please Don't use this code to SPAM the participants.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am not responsible if you break any rules while using it though everything was taken into consideration while writing the code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update - I have added HTML templates for the emails and made a new script called 'email-script-2.py' use that if you want to send mails in the HTML format
Also update the templates with your group links
and always try on a demo dataset first.
Everything else is same as the first script

You can search "*inset-group-link-here*" and replace it with your group link in the all 5 html templates. (search without quotes) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First download the progress report (csv file) sent to you
then rename it progress.csv

open the email-script.py and enter your email ID and password in the main function or generate the app password and use that as password if you have two step verification enabled.

the total worker is 10. you can increase the workers. its totally upto you

Also try on a demo dataset first.

Use the script on your own risk. Don't spam the students.
I wont be responsible if anything happens or if a satellite falls on your system :)
